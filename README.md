# JS library: Timeline2D

## Library description
The library allows developers to generate a 2-dimensional timeline, where one dimension is the unidirectional time flow, while the other dimension is the discrete categories of events. The library helps developers to figuratively compare events of different categories happened during the same time. With the help of this library, developers can spend more time on gathering information on the events they want to compare rather than coding the timeline by themselves. The category can be different things in different use cases. If the developer wants to build an education website about world history, the category can be different countries and the timeline will compare major historical events occurring around the world at the same time. If the developer wants to build a promotion web platform for companies, the category can be different products, and the timeline will show the date of different product releases or company events. If the developer wants to build a project milestone tracker for individual usage, the category can be different projects and the timeline will track the date of milestones and deadlines of different project.
